# Parallel Universes (span 4)

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

When we come to a mapping of a Project, is critical to look for the future of Parts Unlimited otherwise the project will massively over budget and very late. So to deal with this we shall consider to move everything to the cloud…

Since version 3.2 , a new Jekyll project bootstrapped with jekyll new uses gem-based themes to define the look of the site. This results in a lighter default directory structure: _layouts, _includes and _sass are stored in the theme-gem, by default.

```note
In general relativity, gravity is a force that bends and warps space-time around supermassive bodies.
- Even though gravity is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, it is very weak compared to the other three forces (electromagnetism, weak force and strong force). So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.
- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).
- As far as quantum mechanics is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.
- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.

In the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles. Instead of point particles, strings were introduced. Even if strings collide, there will be no infinite energy problem. Strings can smoothly smash and rebound without implying any physically nonsense infinities.

You can attach a persistent disk or create an instance with [Local SSDs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting) when using Container-Optimized OS. The disks _[can be mounted by creating a subdirectory](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/disks-and-filesystem#mounting_and_formatting_disks)_ under `/mnt/disks` directory (writable, executable, stateless, tmpfs) using [startup-scripts](hhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts).

Let's combine them all then we will get 168 which is the total primes out of 1000 numbers. This 168 we will get it also when we combine the 1's and 17's cell of (31+37)+(35+65)=68+100=168.

This can be remedied by re-mounting your Windows partition inside WSL with the metdata option. Edit the /etc/wsl.conf file (create it if it doesn’t exist) and add the following:

```
[automount]
options = "metadata"
```

Log out from WSL and log in again, and now the windows partition will be mounted with metadata and chmod will work against windows files. You can now chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa and everything will work correctly.

# Prime Unit Identity

We are going to assign prime identity as a ***standard model*** that attempts to stimulate a quantum field model called ***[eQuantum](https://github.com/eq19)*** for _[the four (4) known fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction)_.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

This presentation was inspired by [theoretical works](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13468466/OU1938-Y1.1.pdf) from _[Hideki Yukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa)_ who in 1935 had predicted the existence of _[mesons as the carrier particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson)_ of strong nuclear force.

## Addition Zones

Here we would like to explain the way of said prime identity on getting the [arithmetic expression](https://youtu.be/S9oPqBeSsZA) of an ***individual unit identity*** such as a taxicab number below.

```note
It is a taxicab number, and is variously known as Ramanujan's number and the Ramanujan-Hardy number, after an anecdote of the British mathematician _[GH Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy)_ when he visited Indian mathematician _[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)_ in hospital _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)))_.
```

[![Ramanujan-Hardy number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103107461-173c2b00-4671-11eb-962c-da7e9eab022e.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number))

These three (3) number are [twin primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime). We called the pairs as _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_. Our scenario is mapping the distribution out of these pairs by taking the symmetrical behaviour of 36 as the smallest power (greater than 1) which is not a prime power.

```tip
The smallest square number expressible as the sum of **four (4) consecutive primes** in two ways (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 and 17 + 19) which are also **two (2) couples** of prime twins! _([Prime Curios!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=270)))_.
```

```scss
$True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7

      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+     } 36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
```

Thus in short this is all about a method that we called as the ***[19 vs 18 Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/grammar/identition/#the-77-principles)*** of mapping [the quantum way](https://www.google.com/search?q=eQuantum) within a huge of [primes objects](https://github.com/eq19) (5 to 19) by [lexering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_generator) (11) the un[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)ed feed (7) and [parsering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators) (13) across [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) (17).

```

The main background is that, as you may aware, the prime number theorem describes the [asymptotic distribution](https://youtu.be/j5s0h42GfvM) of prime numbers which is still a major problem in mathematic. 

## Multiplication Zones

Instead of a proved formula we came to a unique expression called ***zeta function***. This expression first appeared in a paper in 1737 entitled _Variae observationes circa series infinitas_. 

```tip
This expression states that the sum of the zeta function is equal to the product of the reciprocal of one minus the reciprocal of primes to the powers. But what has this got to do with the primes?  The answer is in the following product taken over the primes p (discovered by _[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)_):
```

![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219739322-ebdc1916-249a-49da-8ded-ce0fe1205550.png)

This issue is actually come from ***[Riemann hypothesis](https://youtu.be/zlm1aajH6gY)***, a conjecture about the distribution of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function that is considered to be ***the most important*** of _[unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)_ in pure mathematics.

```note
In addition to the trivial roots, there also exist ***complex roots*** for real t. We find that the he first ten (10) non-trivial roots of the Riemann zeta function is occured when the values of t below 50. A plot of the values of ζ(1/2 + it) for t ranging from –50 to +50 is shown below. The roots occur each time ***the locus passes through the origin***. _([mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm))_.
```

[![trivial roots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219828222-615a2037-dbcd-4412-95bf-740bb32094de.png)](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm)

Meanwhile obtaining the non complex numbers it is easier to look at a graph like the one below which shows Li(x) (blue), R(x) (black), π(x) (red) and x/ln x (green); and then proclaim "R(x) is the best estimate of π(x)." Indeed it is for that range, but as we mentioned above, Li(x)-π(x) changes sign infinitely often, and near where it does, Li(x) would be the best value.

[![non complex numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219214486-e6412fb0-d190-45ae-990f-524532661444.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better)

And we can see in the same way that the function Li(x)-(1/2)Li(x1/2) is 'on the average' a better approximation than Li(x) to π(x); but no importance can be attached to the latter terms in Riemann's formula even by repeated averaging.

## Exponentiation Zones

The problem is that the contributions from the non-trivial zeros at times swamps that of any but the main terms in these expansions.

```warning
A. E. Ingham says it this way: Considerable importance was attached formerly to a function suggested by Riemann as an approximation to π(x)... This function represents π(x) with astonishing accuracy for all values of x for which π(x) has been calculated, but we now see that its superiority over Li(x) ***is illusory***... and for special values of x (as large as we please) the one approximation will deviate as widely as the other from the true value _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better))_.
```

[![howmany primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87958552-dea18f80-cadb-11ea-9499-6c2ee580a5ca.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#pnt)

Moreover in it was verified numerically, in a rigorous way using interval arithmetic, that _[The Riemann hypothesis is true up to 3 · 10^12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09765.pdf)_. That is, all zeroes β+iγ of the Riemann zeta-function with 0<γ≤3⋅1012 have β=1/2.

```danger
We have Λ ≤ 0.2. The next entry is conditional on taking H a little higher than 10*13, which of course, is not achieved by Theorem 1. This would enable one to prove Λ < 0.19. Given that our value of H falls between the entries in this table, it is possible that some extra decimals could be wrought out of the calculation. We have not pursued this _([arXiv:2004.09765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09765))_.
```

[![functional equation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219715694-751fe538-378d-4f58-ae82-ac9e6823ad65.png)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09765.pdf)

This Euler formula represents the distribution of a group of numbers that are positioned at regular intervals on a straight line to each other. Riemann later extended the definition of zeta(s) to all complex numbers (***except the simple pole at s=1 with residue one***). Euler's product still holds if the real part of s is greater than one. Riemann derived the functional equation of zeta function.

```danger
The Riemann zeta function has the trivial zeros at -2, -4, -6, ... (the poles of gamma(s/2)).  Using the Euler product (with the functional equation) it is easy to show that all the other zeros are in the critical strip of non-real complex numbers with 0 < Re(s) < 1, and that they are symmetric about the critical line Re(s)=1/2. The unproved Riemann hypothesis is that all of the nontrivial zeros are actually on the critical line _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html))_.
```

[![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219720444-e5ba30ac-e000-4c85-8678-186676b93d2b.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html)

If both of the above statements are true then mathematically this Riemann Hypothesis is proven to be incorrect because it only applies to certain cases or limitations. So first of all the basis of the Riemann Hypothesis has to be considered.

```warning
The solution is not only to prove Re(z)= 1/2 but also to calculate ways for the imaginary part of the complex root of ζ(z)=0 and also to solve the functional equations. _([Riemann Zeta - pdf](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Zeta/EZeta.pdf))_
```

[![Riemann hypothesis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/218374273-729fee09-5480-4fb3-a3a6-0dc050bdbe26.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis)

On the other hand, the possibility of obtaining the function of the distribution of prime numbers shall go backwards since it needs significant studies to be traced.

Or may be [start again from the Euler Function](https://youtu.be/FCpRl0NzVu4).

## Identition Zones

_[Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson#Quantum_physics_and_prime_numbers)_ discovered an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery%27s_pair_correlation_conjecture) about the zeros of the [zeta function](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#zeta-function) which dealts with the distribution of primes.

```note
The Mathematical Elementary Cell 30 (***MEC30***) standard _[unites](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/12.html#entrypoint-of-momentum-spin-3)_ the mathematical and physical results of 1972 by _the mathematician Hugh Montgomery and the physicist Freeman Dyson_ and thus reproduces energy distribution in systems as a path plan ***more accurately than a measurement***. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en#similarDocuments))_
```

[![The Mathematical Elementary Cell 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6f/e3/f0/b8f7292f1f2749/DE102011101032A9.pdf)

The path plan assume that a symmetric distribution of prime numbers with equal axial lengths from a ***middle zero axis = 15*** is able to determine the distribution of primes in a given number space. This assumption finally bring us to the equation of ***[Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity)***. 

```note
Euler's identity is considered to be an exemplar of deep mathematical beauty as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers. Three (3) of the basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once each: ***addition***, ***multiplication***, and ***exponentiation*** _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity))_.
```

[![Euler's identity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219584666-703f4584-db7c-4f2d-9714-f52067869ef3.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity)

The finiteness position of Euler's identity by the said _MEC30_ opens up the possibility of accurately representing the self-similarity based on the distribution of _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_ so that all number would belongs together with [their own identitities](https://www.eq19.com/identition/).

Nothing is going to be easly about the nature of prime numbers but they demonstrably congruent to something organized. Let's discuss starting with the _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)_.
